CNN Models in PyTorch
üìå Overview

This repository showcases my implementation of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using PyTorch. Aimed at exploring different CNN architectures, the repository includes both custom-built models and direct imports from PyTorch‚Äôs torchvision library. The models span from foundational CNN layers to advanced, state-of-the-art networks, providing insights into CNN architecture and serving as a hands-on guide for researchers, students, and machine learning enthusiasts.
‚ú® Project Purpose

This project is designed to:

    Explore the architecture of different CNN models and understand their internal workings.
    Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in PyTorch, including building networks from scratch, tuning hyperparameters, and efficiently utilizing pre-trained architectures.
    Experiment with various model configurations and highlight their strengths, use cases, and training requirements, facilitating practical applications in image classification, object detection, and more.

üìÇ Repository Structure

Here's a breakdown of the directory and file structure to help you navigate:

    models/
        Contains scripts for individual CNN architectures. Each script is standalone and easily adaptable for different datasets or tasks.

    datasets/
        Placeholder for datasets to be used in training and testing. Note that datasets can be loaded directly through PyTorch‚Äôs torchvision library, such as CIFAR-10 and MNIST.

    utils/
        Utility functions for tasks like data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization of training results.

üß† Included Models

The repository features a variety of CNN architectures, detailed below:
1. Custom CNNs

    Basic CNN: Handcrafted layer structures, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. Provides a solid foundation in CNN design, illustrating how simple architectures can be assembled from scratch.

2. Advanced Architectures

    ResNet (Residual Networks): Deep networks with skip connections to mitigate vanishing gradients, especially effective for deep learning tasks.
    VGG (Visual Geometry Group): Known for its simplicity and uniform layer configuration with small filters, making it an excellent choice for image classification tasks.
    AlexNet: An early, influential model that brought CNNs into mainstream applications in computer vision.
    InceptionNet (GoogLeNet): Characterized by its Inception modules, allowing efficient use of resources with varying filter sizes in a single layer, leading to high performance.

üõ†Ô∏è Model Training & Usage

Each model can be modified for specific tasks. The repository is designed for easy experimentation:

    Dataset Loading: Replace the default dataset loading code in each model with any custom dataset, following PyTorch‚Äôs DataLoader conventions.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust the learning rate, batch size, optimizer type, and other hyperparameters at the beginning of each script.
    Training and Evaluation: Most scripts include training loops, validation steps, and performance metrics for accuracy, loss, and other essential indicators.

üí° Key Features

    Flexible Architecture Design: Models include both modular imports and custom-built layers, making it easy to experiment with different configurations.
    Pre-Trained Weights: Some models use PyTorch‚Äôs pre-trained weights for faster training on large datasets.
    Compatibility with Transfer Learning: The advanced models support transfer learning, enabling customization for domain-specific applications.
